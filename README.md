# About CPU Flow

CPU Flow is a customizable Rainmeter skin that visualizes your CPU's real-time performance. It displays current and historical CPU usage and temperature using sleek line graphs and text, alongside the current average clock speed. The skin integrates with CoreTemp (by Alcpu) for temperature and clock speed data, while Rainmeter handles CPU usage metrics.

## Customizable Graph Colors

Each line graph can dynamically change colors based on user-defined thresholds, making monitoring performance at a glance easy. These thresholds are fully customizable:

**Temperature Line Graph**: By default, the line turns red if the CPU temperature exceeds 75Â°C.

**Usage Line Graph**: By default, the line turns red if CPU usage exceeds 80%.
